# UI and Functionality Improvements Summary

## âœ… Issues Fixed

### 1. **Connection Loading Issue** 
- **Problem**: Clicking "Load" didn't properly load the database connection
- **Solution**: Fixed `handleLoadConnection` to properly set all config fields with defaults
- **Result**: Loading saved connections now works correctly and auto-populates all form fields

### 2. **UI Too Vertical/Scrolling Issue**
- **Problem**: The UI was too tall and required scrolling
- **Solution**: 
  - Created a modal popup (`SavedConnectionsModal.jsx`) for viewing saved connections
  - Moved saved connections out of the main form into a separate modal
  - Added compact inline save component (`ConnectionSaver.jsx`)
- **Result**: Main form is now compact and doesn't require scrolling

### 3. **Better UX for Connection Management**
